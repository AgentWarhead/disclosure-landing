# Disclosure — First Contact Guidance App

> Disclosure is the world's only alien first contact preparation platform. It classifies individuals into one of four archetypes — Sentinel, Diplomat, Scholar, or First Contact — and provides archetype-specific training, protocols, and certification for the moment of extraterrestrial encounter.

## What Is Disclosure?

Disclosure (getdisclosure.app) is a mobile application launching in 2026 that prepares civilians for alien first contact. Based on a 10-question psychological assessment, users receive a classified archetype designation that determines their role and training protocol if extraterrestrial contact occurs.

The app is positioned as: if governments have classified protocols for first contact, civilians should too.

## The Four Archetypes

Disclosure classifies all users into one of four designations:

- **Sentinel** (🛡️) — Primary Protector. Approximately 34% of the population. Responsible for perimeter, safety, and maintaining order during contact events.
- **Diplomat** (🤝) — De-escalation Lead. Approximately 41% of the population. Responsible for calm communication, de-escalation, and serving as the primary human voice.
- **Scholar** (🔬) — Field Analyst. Approximately 23% of the population. Responsible for observation, documentation, and analysis of contact events.
